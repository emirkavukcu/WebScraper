Dr. The Honourable Ralph Gonsalves, Prime Minister and Minister of National Security, Air and Sea Port Development, Honourable Sir Louis Straker, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Commerce and Her Excellency Inga Rhonda King, Permanent Representative to the United Nations, were present at the voting.\nWith the success of this campaign, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has, to date, become the smallest Member State, in terms of population and territorial mass, to be elected to serve on this very important organ of the United Nations. In keeping with the theme of \u201cFriends of All: We Strive for a Better World\u201d, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is committed to reconditioning the traditional narratives on security by bringing to the fore the particular vulnerabilities of Small Island Developing States (SIDS). As such, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines will work tirelessly towards addressing the unique plight of SIDS, especially as it relates to the nuanced and unprecedented challenges posed by climate change. The recognition of the link between climate change, and economic and human security is an absolute imperative for the survival of SIDS.\nIn addition, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines will continue to actively promote the principles of sovereign equality and respect for international law, non-interference and non-intervention, collective cooperation in solving global problems, as well as the concept of small island exceptionalism. Moreover, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines will seek to work with fellow Council Members, over the period, to address issues of international peace and security, particularly those which concern Africa, the Middle East and Latin America.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nSource: Ministry of Foreign Affair, Trade and Commerce", "id": "0e8ffab950033b178c9166038b267679"}

It was also the one year anniversary of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines becoming a signatory to the treaty.\nThe event, which was co-sponsored by Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, brings the treaty considerably closer to entry into force. To date, 118 countries have signed the ATT, including all of CARICOM. Forty have ratified it, with Saint Vincent and the Grenadines becoming one of six CARICOM countries to do so. The treaty will enter into force and become legally binding 90 days after the 50th ratification. With only 10 ratifications remaining, there will be a strong push for all governments to sign, ratify and implement the treaty as soon as possible. The ATT is a multilateral, legally-binding agreement that establishes common standards for the international trade of conventional arms and seeks to reduce the illicit arms trade and prevent their diversion. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has been instrumental in the ATT process, and even served on the bureau as Vice-President of the 2012 Arms Trade Treaty Conference. Two major regional workshops for CARICOM negotiators were also hosted in the country in May 2012 and March 2013.Ambassador King in her statement during the event noted that while the Arms Trade Treaty was a necessary first step in answering this call, work still needed to be done. \u201cUntil we achieve entry into force and can ensure a strong, universal, and effective implementation, crime and violence as a result of diversion to our porous marine borders will persist.\u201d\u00a0 She also voiced Saint Vincent and the Grenadines\u2019 support for Trinidad and Tobago to host the Secretariat of the Arms Trade Treaty, an endeavor that is endorsed by CARICOM.", "id": "3c6aaa3d361039d8b099601e9877e111"}

As a registered Charity, the organisation has an excellent track-record of delivering high quality activities and events with strong participation and audiences with a cultural impact of global significance.  Vincy Alliance Mas (High Wycombe)\nVincy Alliance Mas launched in 2012 when it became aware of the lack of Vincentian presence that was identified on the streets of Notting Hill carnival due to no other Vincentian Mas band on the road. Vincy Alliance Mas is now the leading Vincentian Mas band at Notting Hill Carnival representing Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in the UK. The organisation\u2019s work has evolved into supporting Vincentian artistes, musicians and designers creating opportunities within the UK Diaspora.  The National Council for Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Associations UK  NC SVGA UK was formed in 1997 to link all the associations in the UK to coordinate any disaster relief and to work with the High Commission in order that items needed were sent to those in need.

The projects to be financed in the second cycle have a combined total capacity of 35 megawatts, bringing reliable and sustainable power to more than 280,000 people in rural communities that lack access to modern energy services.\nThe loans will go to projects in a geographically diverse set of countries including Argentina, Cuba, Iran, Mauritania and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.\u201cRenewable energy offers the prospect of clean, affordable power to the 1.3 billion people currently off the electricity grid,\u201d said IRENA Director-General, Adnan Z. Amin at a press conference today on the sidelines of IRENA\u2019s fifth Assembly. \u201cWhile renewable energy resources are abundant in many communities suffering from energy poverty, finance is still a key challenge for deployment. That is why the partnership between IRENA and ADFD is so important as a pioneering effort.\u201dThis is the second loan cycle of seven, which together will commit USD 350 million over seven years to the deployment of renewable energy in developing countries, with a total project value of an estimated USD 800 million. The funds from ADFD mobilise other funds and will lead to more than double the invested amount.Projects approved for funding in the second loan cycle include solar, hydro, hybrid (wind and solar) and geothermal energy. The projects selected represent a mix of renewable energy sources, are innovative, potentially replicable or scalable, and will improve energy access. \u201cAs part of its mandate to work on projects with a profound impact on the economies of developing countries, ADFD has collaborated with IRENA to support the renewable energy sector as a tool for economic and social development,\u201d said Mr. Adel Abdulla Al Hosani, Director of Operations Department in ADFD. \u201cTowards this priority, we are keen to support the economic development and deployment of sustainable energy projects in countries with immense clean energy potential, but lacking necessary financial resources and project management expertise.\u201dThe IRENA/ADFD Project Facility pioneers the support of renewable energy as a viable and sustainable focus for foreign development assistance that offers long-term social and economic benefits to developing countries.\u00a0\u00a0 The third funding cycle of the Project Facility is now open for project proposals, with concessional loan interest rates of 1-2 per cent. These new, lower rates will support an even broader range of renewable energy projects throughout the remaining five loan cycles. \u201cThe UAE sees renewable energy as a new cornerstone of sustainable development, with dramatic cost reductions having made it the most competitive energy option in many developing countries,\u201d said Dr. Thani Al Zeyoudi, the UAE\u2019s Permanent Representative to the IRENA and Director of Energy and Climate Change at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\u00a0 \u201cThe partnership between ADFD and IRENA provides a powerful way to demonstrate renewable energy\u2019s viability and speed up further deployment.\u201d For more information visit: www.irena.org/adfd.About the Funded Projects Argentina: An innovative four megawatt mini-hydro project in Nahueve is receiving a loan of 15 million dollars. The project will provide a stable energy supply throughout the northern rural region of the province and will pump irrigation and clean drinking water to Nahueve inhabitants. More than 22,500 people will benefit from the project.Cuba: A 10 megawatt solar energy project is receiving a loan of 15 million dollars. The project will provide energy stability, demonstrate renewable energy\u2019s viability in the country, create jobs and help the environment. More than 5,300 people will benefit from the project.Iran: A five megawatt, first-of-its-kind, small-scale geothermal project in Ardebil is receiving a loan of six million dollars. The geothermal power plant will produce electricity and thermal energy for rural Ardebil to provide local heating, greenhouse agriculture and fish farming. Governmental organizations such as the electricity, gas and environment departments, and the local population of 150,000 people will benefit from the project.Mauritania: A one megawatt solar, wind and hydropower hybrid project will receive a loan of six million dollars. The project involves electrification by solar multifunctional platforms for small villages including 10 solar photovoltaic power plants with storage, small wind turbines installed in fishing villages, and the connection of a group of villages with a hydroelectric network. The improved access to electricity will benefit various stakeholders including small villages, rural centres and fishing villages.St. Vincent and the Grenadines: A 10 to 15 megawatt geothermal project is receiving a loan of 15 million dollars. The project will connect to the energy grid to provide a consistent power source for the entire country and will influence the deployment of additional geothermal projects in the Caribbean. The entire population of 104,000 people will benefit from the project.About Abu Dhabi Fund for Development (ADFD)ADFD is a Government of Abu Dhabi national institution established in 1971 to assist developing countries by providing concessionary loans to finance development projects in those countries, as well as direct, long term investments and contributions.

The event was opened by UK Minister of State responsible for the Caribbean, Lord Tariq Ahmad of Wimbledon and Assistant Secretary General of CARICOM, Mr. Joseph Cox.\nPrime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda and Chairman of CARICOM, Hon. Gaston Browne, as well as Ministers from Belize and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, made presentations on the issue, alongside members of the donor community from the US, Canada, World Bank and the Caribbean Development Bank.\nThe event further amplified the challenges that Small Island Developing States (SIDS) face when it comes to access to finance. Some existing mechanisms to deliver concessional and developmental financing do not take into consideration the unique challenges and vulnerabilities that communities in the Caribbean face.\nThese challenges include the devastating impacts of extreme weather events and the effects of economic shocks, such as the impact on tourism dependent economies of COVID19. CARICOM was clear that there is an urgent need to reform, including where eligibility does not take into account the unique vulnerabilities of Small Island Developing States. The event also amplified frustrations on the high level of bureaucracy caused by international organisations, which can impact SIDS' ability to access funding.\nThe UK is committed to supporting the Caribbean and all\u00a0SIDS in finding tangible solutions to the problem.\nCommenting on the event, Lord Ahmad said, \u201cWe need to take a fresh look at finance for small states. Gross national income does not tell the whole story, especially when a natural disaster can wipe out a year\u2019s GDP in a single day. It does not capture the remoteness, vulnerability, or tell us about the challenge of protecting biodiversity and responding to climate change that they face.
